# Introduction

# Background of the problem

# Problem: 
Researchers and students often find it hard to organize data, hypotheses, experiments, observations, and conclusions in one repeatable workflow. This fragmentation can create data silos, inconsistent records, and challenges in reproducing results.

# Goal:
Create a program that promotes a simple, complete representation of the scientific method. This will ensure traceability, reproducibility, and clear documentation of each study from hypothesis to conclusion.

# Objectives
Create a tool that supports the full scientific cycle:

# Methodology

The initial steps include gathering requirements, designing a simple schema, and setting up a data model that can be easily expanded, along with a clear interface for entering and retrieving data. We will focus on key features such as forms, templates, validation, and basic analysis and visualization. Collaboration tools like dashboards and multi-user support will also be included. For testing and deploying, we will use a command-line interface, with an optional graphical user interface to improve the user experience. We will use SQLite for portable storage and Python for its wide range of scientific libraries. Tools like Typer, Pydantic, and FastAPI will support the system. The workflow may start with a notebook-style or no-code approach and then develop to include more complex database and provenance features, ensuring data exports are open and compatible.
